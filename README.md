Built during ETH Denver Hackathon

No one is good enough to consistently buy the dip/sell the peak when buying/selling crypto.  Your best strategy to avoid making a move at the wrong time is to spread your moves out so it is less likely to mistime the market.  As a side-effect I found out just how quick on-boarding with Wyre is -- only *4* steps to go from zero to purchasing on their exchange.
